## Addon Boilerplate

This repository is a boilerplate for scaffolding out Statamic Addons. It's really really simple to get started with this boilerplate, which includes: GitHub Actions for running tests, a setup test suite and base `README.md`.

I use this boilerplate myself as the starting point for any addons I build, feel free to use it to do the same thing yourself. It's kinda like a starter kit but for addons.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository `git@github.com:doublethreedigital/addon-boilerplate.git`
2. Run the script & answer any questions `bash ./boilerplate.sh`
